// Curring

// Currying is the act of taking a function that normally receives more than one argument, such as add, and refactoring it so that it becomes a higher-order function that returns a series of functions each accepting only one argument and only evaluating once we receive our final argument.

const add = x => y => x + y
add(2)(2)
console.log('ðŸš€ ~ file: 02-curring.js ~ line 7 ~ add(2)(2)', add(2)(2))
const add10 = add(10)
const twelve = add10(2)
console.log('ðŸš€ ~ file: 02-curring.js ~ line 9 ~ twelve', twelve)

// Arity describes the number of arguments a function receives. Depending on the number it receives, there are specific words to describe these functions.

// 1. unary
// 2. binary
// 3. ternary
// 4. quaternary

// A function that receives one is called a unary function. A function that receives two arguments is called a binary, three equals a ternary, and four equals a quaternary, so forth and so on. Thus the act of currying can be described as taking a multivariate function and turning it into a series of unary functions.
